@(response:String)(implicit request : Request[AnyContent])
<h1>@response</h1>
@requestInfo(request)

<!-- i'd rather not have to: 
  - add request as an implicit
  - pass it to every template that needs it


  eg: 
  @(response:String)
  <h1>@response</h1>
  @requestInfo()

  aka the fact that it is implicit in the original context should pass it to every template that is invoked from the first one.
